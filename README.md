# Ember Components

##### Ember Components is a comprehensive set of rich web components written purely in Ember.js that let you create an astonishing UI for ambitious web applications.

Please note that the components are designed from the beginning to support most of the variants and are used in production environment in multiple applications,

All our addons are used in our own products and most of them are written purely as Ember components and **Do not wrap external JS libraries to achieve their target**.
